<p><b>Abstract</b>: The goal of this tutorial is to raise the awareness of the EDBT/ICDT attendees about the quality of their presentation, focusing on accessibility and diversity of the target audience. The “traditional” qualities that speakers typically aim for involve the effectiveness of the message: the audience should clearly understand the story told, believe it, and care about it (consistently with the ancient rhetorical appeals of logos, ethos, and pathos, respectively). In this tutorial, we will additionally focus on other qualities that apply to a diverse audience, especially at an international scientific conference. 
    For example, we will discuss how making our presentations easier to understand for people with disabilities, such as by diminishing the reliance on high-quality eyesight (use contrasting color and shapes) or hearing (use captions), can help everyone understand the presentation better.  We will also discuss that illustrations or jokes one chooses to use in a presentation may come up as offensive to people of different backgrounds. Similarly, some metaphors may overly rely on the cultural background of specific groups (e.g., regional politics, metaphors of local sports, popular television series, and so on), thus will likely be missed by others in the audience, excluding them from the conversation.  And we will also discuss that one should be aware of the potential impact of our presentation choices on the endorsement of social wrongs and biases. Finally, we will raise the need to be aware of one’s own accent, which may be difficult for others to grasp, and so it is important to make sure that the slides compensate for this. 
    The tutorial will be interactive, encouraging members of the audience to share tips and experiences, with the group discussion taking up a significant portion of the allotted time.
