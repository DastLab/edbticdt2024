<b><h4 style="color: black;">Formatting guidelines</h4></b>
<p >
     <ul>
		 <li>Papers must be submitted in PDF format and according to the official EDBT ACM proceedings format specified here. Please make sure you are using the modified ACM LaTeX2e style files with ISBN and copyright information. <u>The template can be downloaded here</u>: 
<a href="files/acmart-edbt2023.cls">acmart-edbt2023.cls</a>, <a href="files/sample-edbt2023.pdf">sample-edbt2023.pdf</a>, <a href="files/sample-edbt2023.tex">sample-edbt2023.tex </a>
(Note: to test the EDBT 2023 style files, make sure you place them in the same directory where you extracted the standard ACM Proceedings Format); for convenience, the file 
<a href="files/sample-edbt2023.zip">sample-edbt2023.zip</a>
provides a consolidated basic package). The font size, margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged.</li>
