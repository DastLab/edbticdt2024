<h3><b>Getting to Paestum</b></h3>
<br> 
<h5><b>
    via Naples:</b>
</h5>
<p>
    The best way to reach Paestum is by plane via Naples. The Naples International Airport (NAP) has direct flights to and from most european hub airports </br>
    It is located approximately 5.9 kilometers north-east of the city of Naples in the Capodichino district.<br>
    The airport is effectively organized and connected to the <b>Naples Railway Station</b> through public transportation (<a href="https://www.anm.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1314" target="_blank">Alibus</a>), and to <b>Salerno city</b> with several buses 
    (<a href="https://www.flixbus.com/" target="_blank">Flixbus</a>, <a href="https://www.fsbusitalia.it/content/fsbusitalia/eng.html" target="_blank">FS Bus Italia</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.sitasudtrasporti.it/" target="_blank">Sita trasporti</a>). Alibus runs with a frequency of 2-3 rides per hour, and the trip lasts about 20 minutes. 
    Tickets can be purchases on board or through the App Unicocampania, and cost 5€.<br>
    Air buses to Salerno leave from a bus parking distant about 300 meters from the airstation, along the direction towards car rentals. 
    They leave at 9:15 and 11:30am <b>from Monday to Saturday</b> and the trip lasts about 75 minutes. Tickets can be purchased either on board at about 7€, within stores in the airstation selling Unico Tickets 
    (you need to buy Tic6 ticket at 6,40€), or through the App Unicocampania (Ticket Aircampania from Naples to Salerno at 5,50€). <br>
    BusItalia buses to Salerno leave from the same parking at 11:35am and 5:30pm <b>from Monday to Saturday</b>. Trip duration and tickets similar to Air bus. Similar modalities for Sita buses to Salerno, which leave at 8:45am and 4pm <b>from Monday to Friday</b>.<br>
    <b>If you are travelling on Sunday: </b> the trips from Naples are operated by <a href="https://www.cosat.it/Batt-Na.pdf">Cosat</a>, which leaves from the airport entrance at 8:30am, 12:05pm and 5:30pm on <b>Sundays only</b>.    
    <br>
    For all of them get off in Salerno at Piazza Concordia stop, which is quite close to Salerno Railway Station.<br>
    Cosat also provides a terminal stop at the <b>Battipaglia railway station</b>.
</p>	
<p>
    Once reached either Naples, Salerno or Battipaglia <b>railway stations</b> you can get a <b>Regional Train</b> to either <b>Capaccio-Roccadaspide</b> or 
    <b>Paestum</b> (Please consult <a href="https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html" target="_blank">Trenitalia</a> for timetables) whose trip lasts about 70 minutes from Naples, 35 minutes from Salerno, or 10 minutes for Battipaglia.<br>
