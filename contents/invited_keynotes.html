<h3><b>Keynote 1: Facets of Probabilistic Databases</b><br>by Benny Kimelfeld</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Probabilistic databases are commonly known in the form of the tuple-independent model, where the validity of every tuple is an independent random event.  Conceptually, the notion is more general, as a probabilistic database refers to any probability distribution over ordinary databases.  A central computational problem is that of marginal inference for database queries: what is the probability that a given tuple is a query answer?  In this talk, I will discuss recent developments in several research directions that, collectively, position probabilistic databases as the common and natural foundation of various challenges at the core of data analytics.  Examples include reasoning about uncertain preferences from conventional distributions such as the Mallows model, data cleaning and repairing in probabilistic paradigms such as the HoloClean system, and the explanation of query answers through concepts from cooperative game theory such as the Shapley value and the Banzhaf Power Index.  While these challenges manifest different facets of probabilistic databases, I will show how they interrelate and, moreover, how they relate to the basic theory of inference over tuple-independent databases.

<h3><b>Keynote 2: Fair Decision-Making using Privacy Protected Data</b><br>by Ashwin Machanavajjhala</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: We are in an βage of surveillanceβ. Mass surveillance by governments and corporations has become the norm. While the goal of such data collection is often to learn aggregate trends in populations rather than properties of individuals, current techniques for data sharing and analysis do not sufficiently protect individual privacy. Differential privacy is a principled approach that, in theory, is a perfect solution for addressing these privacy problems and is starting to see adoption by some commercial (e.g., Google and Apple) and government entities (e.g., US Census) for collecting and sharing sensitive user data. However, there are still barriers to wide adoption of differential privacy notably when applied to complex relational data types. In this talk, I will highlight the opportunities and challenges raised by differentially private data analysis techniques with a specific focus on differentially private techniques for answering queries from relational databases. Specifically, I will discuss our recent work on (a) how to specify what should be private, (b) how to optimally add noise to query answers to ensure differential privacy while minimizing error, and (c) how to use noisy answers for data driven decision making.

<h3><b>Keynote 3: Current Challenges in Graph Databases</b><br>by Juan Reutter</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: As graph databases grow in popularity, decades of work in graph query languages and models are materializing in industry standards and in the construction of new graph database systems. However, this surge in graph systems has in turn opened up a series of new, interesting research problems related to graph databases. To name a few of them: graph users need support for graph schemas and analytical queries. Graph engines must be able to deal with both patterns and path queries, which also raises questions on how paths are to be represented and computed by graph engines. Moreover, graph queries often involve complex patterns that are difficult to evaluate using standard relational techniques, and graph analytics tasks put an even higher pressure on graph database engines. In this talk I will discuss current challenges in graph database research, from the design of languages to algorithmic issues raised by the development of graph engines.

<h3><b>Keynote 4: From Data to Models and Back: Experiences from Google's Production ML Pipelines</b><br>by Neoklis (Alkis) Polyzotis</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Building a good ML model requires good input data. Conversely, debugging a model inevitably involves data debugging and understanding. In this talk, I will present our work in supporting key steps in this bidirectional journey, motivated by the needs of large production ML pipelines at Google: connecting structured data to ML, validating the data fed to training and inference, analyzing model performance through the lens of input data, and linking everything together through lineage. Our tools are deployed in ML pipelines at Google and other large organizations (through open-source software), processing several petabytes of data per day and powering models with millions of QPS.
