    <h3><b>"Adaptive database systems: Navigating chaos in a Heterogeneous
        Landscape"</b></h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Database systems face new hurdles with the rise of diverse
        hardware setups and varying workloads. Evolving hardware, with its mix of different components and changing configurations, complicates how data
        moves within systems, affecting performance. At the same time, the surge in data-centric analytics and powerful AI
        models brings a wide range of workloads that systems must handle. The old way of designing systems based on predicted performance doesn't work well
        anymore, leading to inefficiencies. This talk dives into the complexities of modern hardware and diverse workloads in database systems. It highlights the limitations of standard
        approaches. It stresses the need for systems that can adapt without relying on fixed assumptions about hardware or workloads. Our goal is to
        create resilient and efficient database systems ready for heterogeneity and real-time evolution.</p>

    <h3><b>"Natural Language Data Interfaces: A Data Access Odyssey"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="http://web.imsi.athenarc.gr/~georgia/" target="_blank">Georgia Koutrika</a></b></h4>
    <b>Athena Research Center</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Back in 1970's, E. F. Codd worked on a prototype of a natural language question and answer application that would sit on top of a relational database system. 
        Soon, natural language interfaces for databases (NLIDBs) became the holy grail for the database community. 
        Different approaches have been proposed from the database, machine learning and NLP communities. Interest in the topic has had its peaks and valleys. 
        After a long and adventurous journey of almost 50 years, there is a rekindled interest in NLIDBs in recent years, fueled by the need for democratizing data access and by the recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing, in particular. 
        Neural NLIDBs are popping up like mushrooms. Are we close to finding the holy grail of data access? In this talk, we will go over the landscape of NLIDBs covering important research milestones to the latest neural-based developments in the field. 
        We will present the lurking challenges that we need to surpass and the exciting research opportunities that the database community is called to solve.</p>

    <h3><b>"How Database Theory Helps Teach Relational Queries in Database Education"</b></h3>
    <h4>by <b><a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/" target="_blank">Sudeepa Roy</a></b></h4>
    <b>Duke University</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: Data analytics skills have become an indispensable part of any education
        that seeks to prepare its students for the modern workforce. Essential in this skill set is the ability to work with structured relational
        data. Relational queries are based on logic and may be declarative in nature, posing new challenges to novices and students. Manual teaching
        resources being limited and enrollment growing rapidly, automated tools that help students debug queries and explain errors are potential
        game-changers in database education. We present a suite of tools built on the foundations of database theory that has been used by over 1600
        students in database classes at Duke University, showcasing a high-impact application of database theory in database education.</p>

<h3><b>Keynote 1: Facets of Probabilistic Databases</b><br>by Benny Kimelfeld</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Probabilistic databases are commonly known in the form of the tuple-independent model, where the validity of every tuple is an independent random event.  Conceptually, the notion is more general, as a probabilistic database refers to any probability distribution over ordinary databases.  A central computational problem is that of marginal inference for database queries: what is the probability that a given tuple is a query answer?  In this talk, I will discuss recent developments in several research directions that, collectively, position probabilistic databases as the common and natural foundation of various challenges at the core of data analytics.  Examples include reasoning about uncertain preferences from conventional distributions such as the Mallows model, data cleaning and repairing in probabilistic paradigms such as the HoloClean system, and the explanation of query answers through concepts from cooperative game theory such as the Shapley value and the Banzhaf Power Index.  While these challenges manifest different facets of probabilistic databases, I will show how they interrelate and, moreover, how they relate to the basic theory of inference over tuple-independent databases.

<h3><b>Keynote 2: Fair Decision-Making using Privacy Protected Data</b><br>by Ashwin Machanavajjhala</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: We are in an βage of surveillanceβ. Mass surveillance by governments and corporations has become the norm. While the goal of such data collection is often to learn aggregate trends in populations rather than properties of individuals, current techniques for data sharing and analysis do not sufficiently protect individual privacy. Differential privacy is a principled approach that, in theory, is a perfect solution for addressing these privacy problems and is starting to see adoption by some commercial (e.g., Google and Apple) and government entities (e.g., US Census) for collecting and sharing sensitive user data. However, there are still barriers to wide adoption of differential privacy notably when applied to complex relational data types. In this talk, I will highlight the opportunities and challenges raised by differentially private data analysis techniques with a specific focus on differentially private techniques for answering queries from relational databases. Specifically, I will discuss our recent work on (a) how to specify what should be private, (b) how to optimally add noise to query answers to ensure differential privacy while minimizing error, and (c) how to use noisy answers for data driven decision making.

<h3><b>Keynote 3: Current Challenges in Graph Databases</b><br>by Juan Reutter</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: As graph databases grow in popularity, decades of work in graph query languages and models are materializing in industry standards and in the construction of new graph database systems. However, this surge in graph systems has in turn opened up a series of new, interesting research problems related to graph databases. To name a few of them: graph users need support for graph schemas and analytical queries. Graph engines must be able to deal with both patterns and path queries, which also raises questions on how paths are to be represented and computed by graph engines. Moreover, graph queries often involve complex patterns that are difficult to evaluate using standard relational techniques, and graph analytics tasks put an even higher pressure on graph database engines. In this talk I will discuss current challenges in graph database research, from the design of languages to algorithmic issues raised by the development of graph engines.

<h3><b>Keynote 4: From Data to Models and Back: Experiences from Google's Production ML Pipelines</b><br>by Neoklis (Alkis) Polyzotis</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Building a good ML model requires good input data. Conversely, debugging a model inevitably involves data debugging and understanding. In this talk, I will present our work in supporting key steps in this bidirectional journey, motivated by the needs of large production ML pipelines at Google: connecting structured data to ML, validating the data fed to training and inference, analyzing model performance through the lens of input data, and linking everything together through lineage. Our tools are deployed in ML pipelines at Google and other large organizations (through open-source software), processing several petabytes of data per day and powering models with millions of QPS.
