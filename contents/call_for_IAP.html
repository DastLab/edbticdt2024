<p>
The annual International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) is a leading international forum for researchers, developers, and users to present and discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences related to data management.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Industrial & Application</h3></b>
<p>
EDBT invites industrial and application papers that describe important industrial advances and application achievements in all areas of (but not limited to) database and data management systems, scalable machine learning and data mining systems, stream data processing, 
information retrieval, knowledge discovery, data quality and cleaning, information integration, cloud-based systems, mobile data management, and data systems on new hardware. It therefore encourages submissions related to all aspects of data management and data engineering 
as well as work on applying recent research advances to real-world problems and industrial systems, particularly with a focus on the synergies between data management and machine learning. Moreover, new applications, novel systems, challenging real-world use cases, practical customer case-studies, 
insights on the legal, social, and ethical implications of database technology, as well as analysis of applied technology in an industrial context are highly welcome. Submissions that do not articulate the innovative aspect of a product or application, but rather give a general overview, will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
Each submission must include <b>at least one</b> author affiliated with a corporate or government institution during which the project was undertaken.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
During submission of a paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only the PC members with whom they have a conflict of interest (COI), as defined below. 
Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes will be desk rejected.
</p>


<p>
A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or several of the following conditions holds:
    <ul>
        <li>the PC member is a co-author of the paper;</li>
        <li>the PC member has been a co-worker in the same organization within the past ten years;</li>
        <li>the PC member has been a collaborator within the past ten years;</li>
        <li>the PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago;</li>
        <li>the author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago; or</li>
        <li>the PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
</p>

<p>
To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members will be given a list of submitting authors who have indicated that they have a conflict with that PC member.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate submissions and novelty requirements</h3></b>
<p>
A paper submitted to EDBT cannot be under review at any other publishing forum or presentation venue -- including conferences, workshops, and journals -- during the entire period when the paper is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after a paper is submitted to EDBT, the authors must await the response and only then resubmit elsewhere if the paper is rejected (or withdrawn at their request) from EDBT.
</p>

<p>
All papers submitted to EDBT must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is either (a) a paper of <b>5 pages or more</b> presented, or accepted for presentation, at a <b>refereed conference or workshop</b> with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If an EDBT submission has limited (less than 4 pages) overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication and clearly explain the relationship with that prior publication.
</p>

<p>
Any violation of the duplicate submission and novelty requirements will result in an immediate rejection of the submitted paper.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Formatting and submission instructions</h3></b>
<p>
Industrial and application papers should be at most <b>8 pages</b> long excluding references.
</p>


<p>
Each industrial paper is to be submitted as a <b>single PDF file</b>. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file prints easily on simple default configurations. 
Papers should be formatted according to the latest <b>ACM Proceedings Format</b> without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, etc. 
EDBT uses <b>single-anonymous reviewing</b>, which means that the authors should list their names and affiliations as part of their submission. <i>Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Industrial and Application papers are evaluated by a committee specifically formed for this category.</i>
</p>

<p>
All papers have to be submitted electronically at  <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2024">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2024</a>
