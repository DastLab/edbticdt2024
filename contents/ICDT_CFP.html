<p>27th International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT 2024)<br>
Paestum, Italy 25th-28th March 2024<br>

<p>ICDT is a series of international scientific conferences on research of data management theory (<a href="https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages">https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages.</a>). 
    Since 2009, it is annually and jointly held with EDBT, the International Conference on Extending Database Technology.
<p>The 27th edition of ICDT is planned to take place in Paestum, Italy.</p>


<!--
<b><h3 style="color: black;">Broadening Scope</h3></b>
Continuing with the idea of broadening its scope, ICDT 2022 will have a Reach Out track that calls for
<ul>
    <li>Novel formal frameworks and/or</li>
    <li>Articles that connect principles of data management to other communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Papers submitted to this track are expected to introduce novel directions for database theory and provide a theoretical basis for understanding emerging areas in data management. Submissions to this track will be judged mainly in terms of their potential to lead to valuable and impactful theoretical developments. We encourage authors to illustrate the potential impact via convincing examples, preliminary results, and clearly specified open problems. However, the Program Committee reserves the right to re-classify a Reach Out paper submission as a regular submission.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of Interest</h3></b>
<p>
We welcome research papers on *every* topic related to the principles and theory of data management, provided that there is a clear connection to foundational aspects. This includes, for example, articles on "classical" data management topics such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The design and study of data models and query languages</li>
	<li>The development and analysis of algorithms for data management</li>
	<li>The theoretical investigation of various aspects underlying data management systems (indexes, concurrency, distributed computation, privacy and security, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>but also includes papers exploring existing or identifying new connections between data management and other areas, such as the areas of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>knowledge representation, semantic web</li>
	<li>information retrieval and data mining</li>
	<li>machine learning/AI</li>
	<li>distributed computing</li>
	<li>theoretical computer science.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of the above, a clear emphasis on foundational aspects is expected. You may want to check <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html">https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html </a>to get an overview of previous editions of ICDT. The Program Committee reserves the right to desk reject a submission when it is regarded to be out of scope.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Instructions</h3></b>

<p>All submissions will be electronic via Easychair at <br><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icdt2024" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icdt2024.</a>.</p>

<p>Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess their merits. The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia, workshops, and journals.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted as PDF documents, using the LIPIcs style<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors"> (http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors)</a>. Papers must be at most 15 pages, excluding references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which, however, will be read at the discretion of the program committee (online appendices are not allowed). Papers not conforming to these requirements may be rejected without further consideration.</p>

<p>The proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees that the proceedings will be available online and free of charge, while the authors retain the rights over their work.</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference and present the paper.</p>

<br>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Anonymous Submission</h3></b>
<p>
    For 2024, ICDT will adopt anonymous submission, in line with other leading conferences in the database community such as SIGMOD and PODS.  The intent of anonymous submission is to ensure that the identity of the authors is not presented to the reviewers during the review process.  Specifically, submitted papers should not list authors or affiliations, and should not include acknowlegments to funding sources, or other colleagues or collaborators.  References to the authors' own prior work should not be distinguished from other references.  Where this is not possible (for instance, when referring to a specific system to which the authors have privileged access), anonymized citations are permissible.  For more background on the motivation for anonymous submissions, and the mechanisms to achieve it, please consult [Snodgrass, 2007] <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/TODS07.pdf">https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/TODS07.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we encouage authors to make their submissions available to the community via pre-print services such as ArXiv and through talks.  We do require that work is not labeled as "under submission at ICDT" or indicates that it is under review, but otherwise place no restrictions on sharing results.  This does not conflict with the anonymous submission requirement. </p>
<br>



<b><h3 style="color: black;">Awards</h3></b>

<p>An award will be given to the Best Paper. Also, an award will be given to the Best Newcomer Paper written by newcomers to the field of database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper written only by students; in that case the award will be called Best Student-Paper Award. The program committee reserves the following rights: not to give any award; to split an award among several papers; and to define the notion of a newcomer. Papers authored or co-authored by program committee members are not eligible for any award.</p>
