<p>26th International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT 2023)</p>
<p>ICDT is an international conference series on the principles and theory of data management. Since 2009, it is annually and jointly held with EDBT, the International Conference on Extending Database Technology. See also <a href="https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages">https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages.</a> 
<p>The 26th edition of ICDT is planned to take place in Ioannina, Greece, from  28β31 March 2023 (tentative dates).</p>


<!--
<b><h3 style="color: black;">Broadening Scope</h3></b>
Continuing with the idea of broadening its scope, ICDT 2022 will have a Reach Out track that calls for
<ul>
    <li>Novel formal frameworks and/or</li>
    <li>Articles that connect principles of data management to other communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Papers submitted to this track are expected to introduce novel directions for database theory and provide a theoretical basis for understanding emerging areas in data management. Submissions to this track will be judged mainly in terms of their potential to lead to valuable and impactful theoretical developments. We encourage authors to illustrate the potential impact via convincing examples, preliminary results, and clearly specified open problems. However, the Program Committee reserves the right to re-classify a Reach Out paper submission as a regular submission.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of Interest</h3></b>
<p>
We welcome research papers on *every* topic related to the principles and theory of data management, provided that there is a clear connection to foundational aspects. This includes, for example, articles on "classical" data management topics such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The design and study of data models and query languages</li>
	<li>The development and analysis of algorithms for data management</li>
	<li>The theoretical investigation of various aspects underlying data management systems (indexes, concurrency, distributed computation, privacy and security, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>but also includes papers exploring existing or identifying new connections between data management and other areas, such as the areas of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>knowledge representation, semantic web</li>
	<li>information retrieval and data mining</li>
	<li>machine learning</li>
	<li>distributed computing</li>
	<li>theoretical computer science.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of the above, a clear emphasis on foundational aspects is expected. You may want to check <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html">https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html </a>to get an overview of previous editions of ICDT. The Program Committee reserves the right to desk reject a submission when it is regarded to be out of scope.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Cycles and Dates</h3></b>

    <li><b>September 21, 2022</b>: Paper submission deadline</li>
    <li><b>November 20, 2022</b>: Notification</li>
</ul>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Instructions</h3></b>

<p>All submissions will be electronic via Easychair at <br><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icdt2023" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icdt2023.</a>.</p>

<p>Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess their merits. The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia, workshops, and journals.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted as PDF documents, using the LIPIcs style<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors"> (http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors)</a>. Paper length is limited to 15 pages excluding references, both for regular submissions and for the Reach Out Track. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix which will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Online appendices are not allowed. Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be rejected without further consideration.</p>

<p>The proceedings will appear under an open access license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. More specifically, all articles in LIPIcs are published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Thereby, the authors retain their copyrights and readers can re-use the published work in the most meaningful manner. The proceedings will also appear in Scopus.</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference and present the paper.</p>

<!--<p>The EDBT/ICDT 2022 Joint Conference is single-blind, and thus authors must include their names and affiliations in submissions.</p> -->

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Awards</h3></b>

<p>An award will be given to the Best Paper and to the Best Newcomer Paper where `newcomer' refers to the field of database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper authored only by students and in that case be called Best Student-Paper Award. The program committee reserves the right to not give any award and to split an award among several papers. Papers co-authored by program committee members are not eligible for an award.</p>

<p>A more traditional list of topics (not exclusive): ICDT welcomes papers on any topic related to principles of data management such as, for example, data mining, information extraction, information retrieval, database aspects of machine learning, distributed and parallel databases, cloud computing, graph databases, (semantic) Web data, web services, data streams, sketching, data-centric (business) process management and workflows, data and knowledge integration and exchange, data provenance, views, data warehouses, domain-specific databases (multimedia, scientific, spatial, temporal, text), data privacy and security, concurrency, and recovery.</p>
