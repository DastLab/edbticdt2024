    <a href="https://diku-dk.github.io/edbticdt2020/" target="_blank">EDBT 2020</a> will be held in beautiful Copenhagen, Denmark on March 30-April 2, 2020, invites submissions of original research contributions, including experiment and analysis papers, system papers and visionary papers, as well as descriptions of industrial and application results, and proposals for tutorials and demonstrations. Industrial, demo, tutorial, and short paper submissions will be the subjects of further CFPs.
</p>
  -->
  
  
<b><h3 style="color: black;">Paper Types</h3></b>
<p>
In addition to research papers (long and short), the conference invites submissions to the Experiments & Analysis and Vision tracks. All papers are reviewed by the EDBT program committee.
</p>

<p>
<b>Experiments & Analysis (E&A)</b> submissions focus on a comprehensive and detailed performance evaluation, on appropriate methodology, and on an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of ideas published in previous work. The scientific contribution of an E&A paper lies in providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods rather than in providing new methods. Papers proposing new solutions should be submitted to the regular research track.  <b>Titles of E&A papers must start with the phrase β[Experiments & Analysis]β</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Vision</b> submissions describe emerging areas of research or new applications of data management technology. Papers in this track are not required to present research results.  Rather, they may articulate a vision for future research in an important new area, identify challenging technical problems to be addressed, and explain potential technical or social impacts.  <b>Titles of Vision papers must start with the phrase β[Vision Paper]β</b>.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
During submission of a paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paperβs authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only the PC members with whom they have a conflict of interest (COI), as defined below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes will be desk rejected.
</p>

<p>
A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or several of the following conditions holds:
<ul>
 <li> the PC member is a co-author of the paper;</li>
 <li> the PC member has been a co-worker in the same organization within the past ten years;</li>
 <li> the PC member has been a collaborator within the past ten years;</li>
 <li> the PC member is or was the authorβs primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago;</li>
 <li> the author is or was the PC memberβs primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago; or</li>
 <li>the PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
</p>

<p>
To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members will be given a list of submitting authors who have indicated that they have a conflict with that PC member. 
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirements</h3></b>
<p>
A paper submitted to EDBT cannot be under review at any other publishing forum or presentation venue --  including conferences, workshops, and journals -- during the entire period when the paper is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after a paper is submitted to EDBT, the authors must await the response and only then resubmit elsewhere if the paper is rejected (or withdrawn at their request) from EDBT.
</p>

<p>
All papers submitted to EDBT must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is either (a) a paper of five pages or more presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If an EDBT submission has (limited, less than 5 pages) overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication and clearly explain the relationship with that prior publication.
</p>

<p>
A paper submitted to one of the three EDBT 2023 cycles (see important dates below) cannot be submitted to any of the subsequent cycles of EDBT 2023.
</p>

<p>
Any violation of the duplicate submission and novelty requirements will result in an immediate rejection of the submitted paper.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Formatting and Submission Guidelines</h3></b>

<p>All submissions will be electronic via CMT: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2023">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2023</a>.The submission site will be available 15 days before June 1.
</p>

<p>
Regular research papers and Experiments & Analysis papers should be at most 12 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references. Short research papers and Vision papers should be at most 6 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references.
</p>

<p>
Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file prints easily on simple default configurations.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be formatted according to the latest ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, etc.  
</p>

<p>EDBT uses single-blind reviewing, which means that the authors should list their names and affiliations as part of their submission.</p>

<p>Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected.</p>

<p> Once the paper is submitted, EDBT does not accept any changes in the title and/or authorship list, with the rare exception of authors having to comply with the revision requests and to acknowledge the work that
someone has put in to revise a paper according to what the reviewers have requested. If such a change is warranted, the change has to be made on the submission site, and the PC chairs have to be informed through CMT, before the submission of the revised manuscript.</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Artifact Availability</h3></b>
<p>
Authors are strongly encouraged to submit supplemental material, such as
code, data, and other implementation artifacts used to produce the
results reported in the paper. Reviewers will have access to the
supplemental material and consider it in their evaluation of the
scientific quality of the contribution.
</p>

<p>
Authors can submit (a) a single zip file as supplemental material or (b)
include a link to the supplemental material (e.g., a link to a github
repository).

</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Inclusitivity in writing and presentation</h3></b>
<p>
Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work. </p>
<p>
Please visit the subsection βD&I materialsβ at <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/"> https://dbdni.github.io/ </a>for details.
</p>
<b><h3 style="color: black;">Important dates</h3></b>

<p>
EDBT 2023 will again have three annual research paper submission cycles. Each cycle will include an author feedback phase, and an opportunity to submit a revision if the paper receives a 'revise' decision upon the first round of reviews.
