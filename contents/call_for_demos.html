<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">EDBT 2023 Demo Track Call for Papers</h2>

<p>
The annual International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) is a leading international forum for researchers, developers, and users to present and discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences related to data management.
<p>

<p>
The EDBT demonstration program has become an important venue for sharing prototype systems with the greater data management community. We solicit original demonstration proposals that will showcase the most exciting new data management technologies.
</p>

<p>
<b>
We encourage (but not require) authors to include a short video (up to 5 minutes) of their demonstration to illustrate the user experience, and demo scenario.
</b>
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of interest</h3></b>
<p>
We encourage submissions related to all aspects of data management defined broadly, and particularly encourage work on topics of emerging interest in the database research and development communities. We welcome demo papers on all EDBT topics including, but not limited to:

    <ul>
        <li>Availability, reliability, and scalability</li>
		<li>Big data storage, processing and transformation</li>
		<li>Query processing and optimization</li>
		<li>Data models and semantics</li>
		<li>Concurrency control</li>
		<li>Recovery and transaction management</li>
		<li>Cloud data management</li>
		<li>Distributed, decentralized, and parallel data management, distributed ledgers, and blockchains</li>
		<li>Graph data management</li>
		<li>Data management and analytics for semantic web and social networks</li>
		<li>Data platforms for modern hardware and modern hardware for data platforms</li>
		<li>Responsible data management</li>

		<li>Knowledge graphs and knowledge management</li>
		<li>Sensor and mobile data management</li>
		<li>Crowdsourced and collaborative data management</li>
		<li>Spatial, temporal, and geographic data management</li>
		<li>Text data management and information retrieval</li>
		<li>Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate data management</li>

		<li>Heterogeneous databases, data integration</li>
		<li>Data mining and knowledge discovery</li>
		<li>ML/AI for DB and DB for AI/ML</li>
		<li>Data warehousing, large-scale analytics and ETL tools</li>
		<li>Human-data interaction</li>
		<li>Usability of data systems</li>
		<li>Data visualization</li>
		<li>Middleware and workflow management</li>
		<li>Privacy, security, and access control</li>
		<li>Complex event processing and data streams</li>
		<li>Transparency, interpretability, and explainability</li>
		<li>Tuning and monitoring</li>
		<li>Benchmarking and performance evaluation</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Demonstrations may consist of software, hardware, or both. The emphasis of the EDBT demonstration program is on visionary, next-generation systems requiring significant research and development effort.
</p>

<p>
Authors may include a description of the novel intellectual content of the underlying system and of its architecture. The demonstration proposal must include citations of the most relevant papers about the proposed system and any previous publications of that same system.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
The EDBT 2023 demo track follows the same <a href="http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">COI policies of the EDBT 2023 Research Track.</a>
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate submissions</h3></b>
<p>
A demo paper submitted to EDBT 2023 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after you submit your work to EDBT, you must await the response from EDBT and only resubmit elsewhere if your paper is rejected (or withdrawn at your request) from EDBT.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Evaluation Criteria</h3></b>
<p>
Selection of demonstrations for presentation at EDBT is highly competitive. The evaluation criteria include both the audience experience and the novelty of the system. The proposal should also describe in detail what EDBT attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will the audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an interesting scenario or script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the demonstration?
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission guidelines</h3></b>
<p>
Length: Demo papers (including bibliographic references) should not exceed 4 pages.
</p>

<p>
File type: Each paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be formatted according to the latest ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, etc. The conference is single-blind, which means that the authors should include their names and affiliations. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected.
</p>

<p>All papers should be submitted electronically at <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2023">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2023</a></p>
