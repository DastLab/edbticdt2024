<br/>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2013, the International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT) began awarding the ICDT Test-of-Time (ToT) award, with the goal of recognizing one paper, or a small number of papers, presented at earlier ICDT conferences that have best met the “test of time”. 
In 2024, the award recognizes two papers selected from the proceedings of the ICDT 2014 conference that have had the highest impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice over the past decade. 
The award will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2024 Joint Conference, March 25 – 28, 2024, Paestum, Italy.</p>
