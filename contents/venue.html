<h3>Ioannina (Epirus, Greece)</h3>
<p>
    Located in the Ξorthwestern part of the country, Ioannina sits in the center of a valley, amongst enormous mountains near a wonderful lake, just an hour from the sunny Ionian Pelago beaches. The town was built on the famous Egnatia Odos, the road that connects Europe with Asia, one of he most ancient routes in history, once used by the Persians and ancient Greeks.

<p>
The best way to reach Ioannina is by air via Athens, which is well connected with the rest of the world.
You can book a (return) domestic flight from Athens International Airport to Ioannina via the official Aegean Airlines website: <a href="https://en.aegeanair.com/">en.aegeanair.com</a>
Two return flights from Athens to Ioannina are scheduled daily, one at 10:15am and one at 18:10pm (flight duration is 1h:15m). Conference participants are advised to book their ATH-IOA-ATH flights early and find appropriate connection flights to/from Athens in order to avoid lengthy transfer periods. Please note that it might be easier to book the ATH-IOA-ATH flight separately from your trip to Athens, rather than using flight search tools for the entire trip.
Taxi service from Ioannina airport to the conference hotel currently costs about 10 euro.
