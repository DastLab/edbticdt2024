<!--<h2>Paestum</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Paestum was a major ancient Greek city on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia (southern Italy), founded around 6th century BCE. Paestum later fell under Roman control and was eventually abandoned in the early Middle Ages. 
    The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BC, which are in an excellent state of preservation: the Temple of Hera (also known as the Basilica), the Temple of Athena (commonly referred to as the Temple of Ceres), and the Temple of Neptune (or Poseidon).   
    Today, Paestum is part of the city of Capaccio-Paestum in the Province of Salerno, which is is one of the biggest towns in northern Cilento, with a population of 22,802.
    The city, directly to the south of the archaeological site, is a popular seaside resort with long sandy beaches.
