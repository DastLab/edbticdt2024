<p>This activity aims to get the audience to express their thoughts on important aspects of diversity and inclusion by sharing their individual lived experiences, and to come up with new ways of making the field of data management more attractive and friendly to people from the outside. We wish to do so in a way that is collaborative, fun, engaging, and accessible.</p>

<p>For this, we will use <i>unfinished comics</i> – a technique that uses incomplete comic panels and elements to engage participants in collaborative design activities.   Participants will be given unfinished comic materials (i.e., comic panels, and supplemental elements to add text captions, dialogue, annotations).  They will use these materials to “finish” the comic, drawing from their lived experiences, to interpret the visuals and construct the narrative text. </p>

<p>Participants will work individually or in small groups to create comics. Good comics tell a story that is based on one’s lived experience, this is why we position this as a diversity & inclusion activity.  We will encourage participants to create comics based on two general prompts.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Prompt 1: </b>Share your experience in the data management research community, focusing on some of the challenges you may be facing or have faced in the past, perhaps due to your demographic or socioeconomic background, along with some strategies for addressing these challenges.  We’d like to hear your personal story and your lived experience through the comics.</li>
    <li><b>Prompt 2: </b>Teach people about data management or AI in a fun and insightful way. Explain how data and/or AI impact our lives, ideally, based on your own lived experience.  Think about how you would motivate people to become interested in data management as a research topic?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Activity outline (90 minutes)</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>15 minutes: Introduction and context-setting </li>
    <li>40 minutes: Construction of comics, in small groups or individually</li>
    <li>25 minutes: Presentation of “finished” comics, poll to determine the winners</li>
    <li>10 minutes: Wrap-up</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants will vote on the “finished” comics. <b>Each member of the winning team will receive the “audience favorite” prize</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>A version of this activity is being offered at AAAI 2024 on February 23, 2024, as one of the interactive diversity & inclusion activities at the conference, see <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/aaai-24-diversity-inclusion-activities/" target="_blank">here</a> for details.</p>

<p><b>Falaah Arif Khan</b> is a PhD student at the Center for Data Science at New York University. Her research centers around the question: What does it mean for the outcomes of a data-driven system to be fair, and how do we encode this pluralistic concept into algorithms? Her research grounds existing statistical fairness definitions in strong normative foundations, proposes new desiderata that unify non-discrimination and non-arbitrariness concerns, and takes a holistic data-centric view of fairness over the ML lifecycle. Falaah is also an artist and creates comic books to disseminate her research to a broader audience. More information about her work is available on her <a href="https://falaaharifkhan.github.io/research/" target="_blank">website</a>. </p>

<p><b>Julia Stoyanovich</b> is Institute Associate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering, Associate Professor of Data Science, and Director of the Center for Responsible AI (<a target="_blank" href="https://r-ai.co/">https://r-ai.co/</a>) at New York University.  Her goal is to make “responsible AI” synonymous with “AI”.  She works towards this goal by engaging in academic research, education and technology policy, and by speaking about the benefits and harms of AI to practitioners and members of the public. Julia’s research interests include data management and AI systems, and AI ethics and legal compliance.   She has co-authored over 100 academic publications, and has written for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Le Monde.  Julia holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University, she is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and a Senior Member of the ACM.</p>
