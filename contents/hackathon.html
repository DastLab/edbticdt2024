<b>Dear Players,</b>
</h5>    

<p>
We are writing to you to let you participate in an interesting initiative that will allow you to concretely apply the theoretical knowledge you have acquired.
</p>

<p>
"Map the Unseen Salerno Hackfest" is a unique hackathon that aims to transform the tourism sector through the use of fair indexing.
Our Salerno Hackfest encourages participants to develop solutions that ensure a balanced representation of various tourist attractions, contributing to a more equitable distribution of tourism. Our aim is to offer tourists a wider range of choices, promoting lesser-known destinations and contributing to more sustainable tourism.

</p>

<p>
Teams will have a <b>Palantir Foundry suite</b> where they can develop their analyses.<br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> subscribe to the <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/opendataplayground/1174962" target="_blank"><b>TICKET TAILOR PAGE</b></a> by <b>Tuesday, March 12th</b> to be able to take advantage of them during the hackathon!<br>
This will allow them to use internationally recognized enterprise software and will be able to obtain very useful practical knowledge that they can use in the workplace when they need it.
</p>

<p>
We also thank the Data Providers of the hackathon: <b>ISTAT</b> and <b>ISPRA</b>, who will allow participants to compare themselves with real data.
