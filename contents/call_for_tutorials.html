<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">EDBT/ICDT 2023 Call for Tutorials</h2>
<p>
We solicit proposals for tutorials for presentation at the <a href="http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=important_dates.html">EDBT Conference</a> to be held in Ioannina, Greece. Proposals must provide an in-depth survey of the selected topic with the option of describing specific works in depth. Proposals should include a meaningful summary of open issues in the area. The topic of the tutorial should be broad enough to attract a significant audience and must include enough details to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Starting this year, EDBT tutorials will be archived on EDBT Learning Center website, which will include both a video recording of the tutorial, as well as an archival proceedings entry. Details on the new requirements can be found in the submission guidelines.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Guidelines</h3></b>
<p>
Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, as a single PDF file to the Tutorial Chairs, Ioana Manolescu (<a href="mailto:ioana.manolescu@inria.fr">ioana.manolescu@inria.fr</a>) and Xiaofang Zhou (<a href="mailto:zxf@ust.hk">zxf@ust.hk</a>). The submission should not be more than 4 (four) pages long and papers should be formatted according to the ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, etc. The template information can be found at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>. The conference is single-blind, which means that the authors should include their names and affiliations. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Preferred duration (1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of either length, please be sure to identify which material in each case)</li>
    <li>Abstract</li>
    <li>Outline presenting the scope and depth of the coverage of the topics to be addressed by the tutorial</li>
    <li>Goals and objectives</li>
    <li>Intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge the audience must have</li>
    <li>Biography (no longer than a few sentences) of the speakers, including contact information</li>
    <li>If an earlier version of the tutorial has been presented in a different venue, indicate those venues as well as the difference in the content with the other editions of the tutorial</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note the following requirements for the tutorial program.
</p>
<p>
1.EDBT has a new initiative to keep video recordings of all the tutorials as part of the EDBTpedia permanently (<a href="http://edbtpedia.com/">http://edbtpedia.com/</a>). The tutorial presenters have two options: (i) you can provide your own recording of the tutorial, which will become part of EDBTpedia, or (ii) the recording of the live tutorial presentation will go into EDBTpedia. In any case, the presenters are expected to be there at the live event to give the tutorial - not just play a pre-recorded video. 
</p>
<p>
2. Selected tutorials will be archived as articles in the conference proceedings. Different from the tutorial proposal, the short article (4 pages) is expected to summarize the tutorial and be of educational nature, providing an introduction to the presented topic and highlights of the main works. Details on the formatting of the tutorial articles will be provided to the authors of tutorials selected for presentation at EDBT 2023 at a later date.
