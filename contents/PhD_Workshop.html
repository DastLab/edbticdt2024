We are very pleased to announce Boris Glavic as our invited keynote speaker.

<h3><b>Keynote:  How-to-PhD - A Dummies Guide towards Research</b><br>by Boris Glavic</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Perhaps you just started your Ph.D. and are still trying to navigate the world of academia and find your thesis topic or you are a seasoned Ph.D. student about to gradate who wants feedback on your body of work. No matter where you are in your journey, it is easy to get stuck in the day-to-day life as a researcher, become a cog in the machine of academia and its publish-or-perish paradigm, and wander off the righteous path. Worry not! In this talk, we are going to take a step back and start from the fundamental question of "What is (CS) research?" and based on the answer to this question reflect on how we should go about the daily activities of a scientist such as literature research, selecting an interesting research problem to work on, experimental evaluation of hypotheses, formalization and theoretical analysis of a problem and solution, systems building, and communicating research ideas and findings (in written form of a publication or in form a presentation).
