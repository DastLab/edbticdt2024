		<h3><b> Keynote: Post-PhD Career: Things I Wish I Had Known</b></h3>
		<h4>by <b><a>Paolo Papotti</a></b></h4>
		<b>EURECOM</b>, France
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract</b>: A PhD in data management can lead to a number of different careers. 
			There are examples of DB researches thriving in research labs, professors with amazing groups, and even CTOs leading start ups including one of the biggest social networks. 
			Still, identifying the 'ideal' career path during postgraduate studies is a formidable challenge, also due to numerous influential factors, such as geographical location and the nature (public or private) of the institutions in question. 
			In this talk, drawing upon my diverse experiences across three continents and in various roles, I will share some stories about my journey to shed some light on these dynamics. 
			While there is no universal blueprint for decision-making, this presentation aims to equip participants with an understanding of the career landscape and what it entails when transitioning into their first post-PhD role.

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Georgia Koutrika</b></i> is a Research Director at Athena Research Center in Greece. Before that, she worked at HP Labs, and IBM Almaden. 
			She was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, and she earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, in Greece. 
			Her research emerges at the intersection of data management and deep learning, focusing on conversational data exploration, fairness, and learnt data management. 
			Her work has been incorporated in commercial products, described in 19 granted patents and 26 patent applications in the US and worldwide, and published in top-tier conferences and journals.
			She is a member of the VLDB Endowment Board of Trustees, coordinating EiC for VLDB Journal, and chair of the ACM Europe Working Group on Seasonal Schools. 
			She is EDBT2025 Demo Chair, and she was PC co-chair for VLDB 2023, co-EiC of Proceedings of the VLDB (PVLDB) Vol 16, general chair for ACM SIGMOD 2016, and member of the PVLDB Advisory board.

We are very pleased to announce Boris Glavic as our invited keynote speaker.

<h3><b>Keynote:  How-to-PhD - A Dummies Guide towards Research</b><br>by Boris Glavic</h3>
<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>: Perhaps you just started your Ph.D. and are still trying to navigate the world of academia and find your thesis topic or you are a seasoned Ph.D. student about to gradate who wants feedback on your body of work. No matter where you are in your journey, it is easy to get stuck in the day-to-day life as a researcher, become a cog in the machine of academia and its publish-or-perish paradigm, and wander off the righteous path. Worry not! In this talk, we are going to take a step back and start from the fundamental question of "What is (CS) research?" and based on the answer to this question reflect on how we should go about the daily activities of a scientist such as literature research, selecting an interesting research problem to work on, experimental evaluation of hypotheses, formalization and theoretical analysis of a problem and solution, systems building, and communicating research ideas and findings (in written form of a publication or in form a presentation).
