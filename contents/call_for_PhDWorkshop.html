<p> 
The second edition of the EDBT PhD Workshop is an opportunity for graduate students to present and discuss their research work at a premier international conference. The workshop provides a forum that facilitates interactions among PhD students and stimulates feedback from more experienced researchers.
</p> 	

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of interest</h3></b>


<p>
EDBT 2024 welcomes submissions from PhD students who have not yet received their PhD degrees. If you are in the early stages of your studies, the submission should clearly describe the problem you are working on, explain why it is important, detail why the existing solutions are not sufficient, and outline the new solutions you are pursuing. If you are further along or close to completion, the submission should be more concrete, describing your contribution during your PhD studies so far, and what you hope to accomplish next.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Guidelines</h3></b>

<p>
PhD workshop submissions must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, using the PhD Workshop Track on CMT: <a href=https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2024>https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2024</a>
</p>

<p>
Submissions must be single-author and must identify any supervisors with "supervised by" on the paper and below the author's name.
</p>

<p>
Papers are limited to 4 pages in 2-column style (including all material) and must be formatted with the same rules as EDBT Workshop papers using the CEUR-ART style (templates for LaTeX and DOCX are available here:  <a href=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip>http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip</a>, and on overleaf: <a href=https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt>https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt</a>). Please make sure to enable the two-column style in the template. The font size, margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged.
</p>

<p>
It is acceptable if portions of the thesis work have been published or submitted for publication. Since the submission is limited to 4 pages, it does not constitute a duplicate submission to EDBT.
</p>

<p>
We plan to publish the PhD workshop proceedings with all accepted workshop papers in the CEUR-WS series.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Review Process</h3></b>

<p>
The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors; these include the quality of your proposal and where you are within your doctoral education program. The program committee will give the strongest consideration to candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on their dissertation, and who still have time to be influenced by participation in the PhD Workshop.
