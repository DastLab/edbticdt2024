<p>
    The entire <b>Organizing Committee</b> would like to thank all of the student volunteers who have helped organizing <b>EDBT/ICDT 2024</b> to ensure that we can deliver the best event possible.
    So many of the beautiful things we have prepared for the event would not have been possible without their contribution.
